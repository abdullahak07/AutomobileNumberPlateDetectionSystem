# AutomobileNumberPlateDetectionSystem
As the number of vehicles has been increased with considerable amount during the recent years,
more and more attention is to be paid on advanced, efficient and accurate intelligent transportation
systems (ITSs). One of the important technique used in ITS is Automobile Number Plate Detection
system. ANPD is a computer vision technology that recognizes the vehicleâ€™s number plate without
direct human intervention. This system extracts the characters of the number plate from the
captured images of the vehicle, which can be further used for various purpose. Hence it can be used
in traffic management applications like automatic gate control for authorized/non-authorized
vehicles, entrance admissions in toll systems, monitoring of traffic violations, borders crossing
control and premises where high security is needed, such as the Parliament building, etc.
